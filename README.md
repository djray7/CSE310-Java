# Overview

I choose this project to provide a somewhat straightforward oportunity to learn the basis of this language. 

The softare is just meant to keep track of expenses. It gives the user the option to view a summary of all their expenses, or a summary of each category individually

My thought of using this project is to just to keep track of expenses.

# Future Work

* Find out why the lists won't update when called by the display class. Get that work.
* Add in a warning to identify when a limit has been reached, so that the person doesn't spend over their budget. 
* Perhaps switch the displays so that it immediately shows all the expenses one by one.
